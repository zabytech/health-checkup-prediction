# Health Checkup Prediction System

This project predicts an individual's health checkup frequency using
machine learning techniques based on lifestyle, health conditions,
and demographic factors.

## Dataset
- Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) dataset
- 300,000+ records
- Features include health conditions, lifestyle habits, BMI, age category,
  and consumption patterns

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that predict
health checkup frequency and demonstrate real-world healthcare analytics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

## Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data preprocessing and encoding
3. Train-test split (80:20)
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Accuracy comparison visualization
7. Single-record prediction demonstration

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~77.5%
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~77.3%
- Tuned models achieved similar performance

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow
using a large real-world healthcare dataset.
